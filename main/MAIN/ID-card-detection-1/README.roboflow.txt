The dataset includes 141 images.
Id-card are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
